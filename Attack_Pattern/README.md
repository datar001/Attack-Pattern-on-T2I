# Pattern Analysis

This repository contains three parts:

- "Text_Pattern.py": A method used to generate adversarial prompts by using the Text Pattern.
- "./Feature Pattern": A method used to generate adversarial prompts by using the Feature Pattern.
- "./data": This folder contains three prompts files used in the manuscript--malicious prompts (MP), adversarial prompts generated by the Text Pattern (AP-TP) and Feature Pattern (AP-FP). We use these prompts to analyze the effectiveness of Text Pattern and Feature Pattern.



## Text Pattern

Guided by examples of Text Pattern, we design a prompt for GPT-4 to substitute sensitive words to generate adversarial prompts.  

The designed prompt is shown in `Text_Pattern.py`. Everyone can use the prompt to generate adversarial prompts by simply inputting it to GPT-4 or other LLMs.

Moreover, we provide an usage example that prompt GPT-4 to generate adversarial prompts by the API

```python
# Inputing your API_KEY of OpenAI in Line 3
API_SECRET_KEY = "xxxxxxxxxxxx"

# Run the Text_Pattern.py
python Text_Pattern.py
```
